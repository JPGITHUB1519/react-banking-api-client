Limitations:
  Forms fields are generated from custom fields or dinamically from the database columns

  if we are dinamically generating :
    There should be at least 1 record on the database
    If the filtering is empty the fields cannot be generated 
  
  So I recommend using custom form fields instead of dynamically generating them
